## Description

This is my professional portfolio as a front end web developer. It's an updated iteration of the original pure CSS version (https://digitallyalex.github.io/alexandra-asanache-portfolio/), created using Bootstrap. 

Besides sharing a little about me and my experience, showcasing my past and current deployed projects, and contact details, I added an extra section which shows my skills relevant to the web development field.

This was a great learning experience, and it showed me how fast I can build a website using Bootstrap elements - a definite improvement from my previous project!

As with the original, I expect to re-work this project and update it to be more in line with my upgraded skill set.

Through the navigation bar of the website, users can easily get to the sections they're interested in.

The first section shows my front-end web development skills, while the second one offers an insight into past and current projects, along with the skills I implemented in my work.

Lastly, I have combined my about and contact information in one section, separated by an avatar which contains my photo and a few fun elements that highlight my skillset while transmitting my warm, fun and creative personality.

As with the first iteration, responsiveness and accessibility were very important to make sure that the website is easy to view on different devices. This part was significantly easier thanks to Bootstrap technology.

If you encounter any issues with the accessibility of this website, please let me know.
